Find the center of an arc in an image's edge

I took some solar eclipse pictures during the Greate American Eclipse
on August 17, 2017. From where I was I can only see up to 74% of partial
eclipse. The pictures are taken with Sony A6000 on a 200mm aperture f/6
homemade Dobsonian telescope riding on a homemade equatorial platform.
The platform is far from perfect so the sun in the images is not 
consistently at the same place. Here I'd like to find the center of the 
sun based on the edge arc.
